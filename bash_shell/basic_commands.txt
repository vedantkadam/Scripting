We can access bash using WSL with triggers in built ubuntu anyways...

1. using vim editor (https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-vim-save-quit-exit)
vim file.txt - creates a file in the directory and enter in it
- i to start inserting
- esc to exit the inserting
- (shift) :wq (to write the file and quit it)

2. touch file.txt (create file)

3. cat file.txt (reads file)

4. head / tail file.txt (reads bottom or top lines)

5. chmod perms command list here - (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/file-permissions-in-linux-chmod-command-explained/)

6. grep command to filter out things for eg
ls -l usr/bin | grep bash
